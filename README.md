# DREAM_BETA

![Flight Controller](Images/1.jpg)

DREAM_BETA is an open source project dedicated to designing and developing a flight computer for FPV drones. The board is created to run the BetaFlight firmware.

## Project History

DREAM_BETA evolved from earlier personal. Starting with the LEVEL project in 2021, which focused on building flight controllers for various aerial vehicles, the concept matured through iterations like DREAM_ALPHA. DREAM_BETA represents the next step: adapting the flight controller design to meet modern FPV software.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **DREAM_BETA**
  - **Hardware**
    - **DB_ELRS_R1_(ELRS_Receiver)** â€“ Design files for the ELRS radio receiver *(designed and fabricated, not yet tested)*
    - **DB_FC_R1_(Flight_Controller)** â€“ Design files for the flight controller *(tested and validated; schematic corrections highlighted in orange have not been applied to the Gerber files)*
  - **Firmware/**
    - `config.h` â€“ Configuration file with pin declarations and board-specific settings
    - `betaflight_4.5.0_STM32F405_DREAM_BETA.hex` â€“ Precompiled BetaFlight firmware for the flight controller
  - **Images/**
    - `1.jpg` â€“ Photo of the flight controller prototype
